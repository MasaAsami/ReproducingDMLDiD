# ReproducingDMLDiD
- This repository is for replication experiments of the following paper.
- original paper:<br>
**Chang, Neng-Chieh. "Double/debiased machine learning for difference-in-differences models." The Econometrics Journal 23.2 (2020): 177-191**

- Very good paper, but seems to be somewhat deficient in the simulation and empirical part.
- The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of DMLDiD while modifying the author's implementation.
- In addition, a Python package for this model is under development.
